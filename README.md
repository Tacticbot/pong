# Pong Game

This Python program simulates the classic Pong game using the Turtle library.

## Overview

The Pong Game is a recreation of the classic Pong arcade game. It features a simple graphical user interface where two paddles hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score against your opponent.

## Features

- **Paddle Controls**: 
  - The right paddle is controlled using the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.
  - The left paddle is controlled using the "W" and "S" keys.

- **Game Logic**:
  - The ball moves continuously and bounces off the paddles and walls.
  - Scoring increments when the ball passes the opponent's paddle.
  - The game resets after a score and continues endlessly.
